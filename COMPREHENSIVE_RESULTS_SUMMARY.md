# HeartMAP: Comprehensive Results Summary

## Project Overview

HeartMAP (Heart Multi-chamber Analysis Platform) is a comprehensive framework for analyzing cell-cell communication across all four chambers of the human heart using single-cell RNA-seq data. The platform integrates multiple models and analysis pipelines to provide a holistic view of cardiac cellular interactions, chamber-specific biology, and therapeutic opportunities.

## Models and Analysis Pipelines

### 1. Basic Pipeline
- **Purpose:** Foundation single-cell analysis (preprocessing, QC, clustering, annotation, basic communication)
- **Key Results:**
  - Identified major cardiac cell types (cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial, immune)
  - High-quality data with minimal technical artifacts
  - Basic ligand-receptor communication networks

### 2. Advanced Communication Analysis
- **Purpose:** Temporal, pathway, and hub analysis of cell-cell communication
- **Key Results:**
  - Temporal dynamics of communication
  - Identification of communication hubs (key cell types driving signaling)
  - Pathway enrichment (cardiac development, contraction, immune response)
  - Chamber-specific communication specificity

### 3. Multi-Chamber Atlas (HeartMAP Core)
- **Purpose:** Chamber-specific and cross-chamber communication analysis
- **Key Results:**
  - Chamber distribution: RA (28.4%), LV (27.0%), LA (26.4%), RV (18.2%)
  - Chamber-specific marker genes (e.g., NPPA, MYL7, FHL2)
  - Cross-chamber expression correlations (RV-LV highest, LA-LV lowest)
  - 150+ differentially expressed genes per chamber pair
  - Chamber-specific therapeutic targets

## Relationships Between Models

- **Progressive Complexity:**
  - Basic pipeline → Advanced communication → Multi-chamber atlas
- **Complementary Insights:**
  - Basic: Cell types and general communication
  - Advanced: Temporal and pathway-level insights
  - Atlas: Chamber-specific and cross-chamber biology
- **Data Flow:**
  - Raw data → Basic pipeline → Advanced/Atlas (scaled for performance)

## Importance and Impact

- **Biological:**
  - First comprehensive multi-chamber communication map
  - Reveals chamber-specific and cross-chamber signaling
  - Identifies unique therapeutic targets for each chamber
- **Clinical:**
  - Enables chamber-specific treatment strategies
  - Informs drug development and personalized medicine
- **Technical:**
  - Scalable to standard hardware (M1 MacBook Pro, 16GB RAM)
  - Reproducible, modular, and extensible

|---------|---------------------------|---------|
| RA      | NPPA, MIR100HG, MYL7      | 28.4    |
| LV      | CD36, LINC00486, FHL2     | 27.0    |
| LA      | NPPA, ELN, MYL7           | 26.4    |
| RV      | NEAT1, MYH7, FHL2         | 18.2    |

## Next Steps
- Validate markers and communication patterns with literature and experiments
- Integrate spatial transcriptomics and disease data
- Develop chamber-specific clinical applications
